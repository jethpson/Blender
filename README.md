# Blender

Blender, is a powerful and open-source 3D computer graphics software, it has found extensive use across various industries due to its versatility, robust feature set, and cost-effectiveness. 

In my case I am able to create fast mock-ups of objects I need to print and am able to do so with the limited measuring tools at my disposal.
I have over 400 hours in blender and while that is not reflected in my repository I will do better at saving my work in the future.
